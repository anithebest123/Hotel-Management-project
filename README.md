# Hotel-Management-OOP-Project

This is a Hotel Management Tool built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java.
It provides a complete menu-driven system to manage various hotel operations, ensuring a smooth and efficient workflow.

The tool supports:

📋 Customer Management – Store and retrieve customer details

🛏️ Room Booking – Book rooms of four different types with availability check

🍽️ Food Ordering – Order food for specific rooms

🚪 Unbooking – Release rooms when customers check out

💵 Billing System – Generate and display detailed bills

🔍 Room Information – View features and availability of different room types

✨ Key Highlights

🖥️ Menu-Driven Program – Runs continuously until the user exits

💾 File Handling with Persistence –

Stores the current hotel status (customer details, room bookings, food orders) into a file at exit

Reads back the saved state when the program restarts, ensuring no data loss

⚡ Multithreading – File writing is handled in a separate thread, allowing parallel execution

🚫 User-Defined Exception – Raised if a user tries to book an already allocated room

🛡️ Robust Exception Handling – Manages unexpected runtime errors gracefully
